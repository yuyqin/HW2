	<h2> About Me  </h2>
		<p> 
		I come from Suzhou, Jiangsu, China, which is a traditional city near Shanghai. I was good at playing the violin and handwriting and in my spare time, I was used to watch TV, read books and listen to the music.
		I like travelling to the world. I've already travelled to many interest of places including most part of China and before 18, I've been to the Britain and Singapore and when I came to the University of Iowa, I travelled to many states and Mexico with my roommates.
		
		</p>

		<p>
		I love my hometown, which is very modern and full of interest of places. As people know, Suzhou is famous as its gardens; however, I didn't visit many famous gardens in my life.
		I always went back to China when the it comes to holidays. Actually, I didn't good at operate with computers but I chose this major and I think it's interesting. Accounting and Finance major is boring to study.
